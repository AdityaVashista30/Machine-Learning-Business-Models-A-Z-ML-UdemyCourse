Various ML models and their implementation, along with dimensionality reduction and finding optimized and best models
The sample dataset worked upon are provided in the sub-folders itself
For CNN model, data set are compressed in a zip file where test and train pictures are already sepreated in different folders of same name.
Types of models created for business purposes are:
